# WikiGraph
Java Project used to experiment with Concurrent Programming Paradigms (executors, event loop, and reactive).

When run you can specify the concurrent paradigm to test and measure performance differences.
Then you can play with controls and make it draw fancy colored graphs based on Wikipedia 'About' section of words searched (you choose the root).
